# Greedy Robots

<b>The Greedy Robots project was developed to display the maximum number of deliveries a group of robots could complete, given various distances and robot travel ranges. It was developed with a greedy algorithm, leading to a runtime of O(RM), with R being number of robots and M being number of buildings.</b>

<h2>Program Aspects</h2>

<b>Within Greedy Robots, multiple intergral programming concepts and aspects are displayed. These aspects include: </b>
- Data Management
- Greedy Algorithm Analysis
- Runtime Management
- Reading from Files
